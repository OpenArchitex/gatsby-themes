## Research

My research interests lie in the area of Groups, Rings, Lie and Hopf Algebras. The results obtained by me (often in cooperation with my colleagues) deal with the following matters:

- Identical relations and varieties of Lie and associative algebras and superalgebras,
- Enveloping algebras and representations of Lie algebras and superalgebras,
- Automorphism groups of certain Lie algebras,
- Structure and representations of locally finite Lie algebras,
- Algebras with actions and coactions of Hopf algebras,
- Graded algebras and applications.

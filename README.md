  Gatsby Themes by OpenArchitex
</h1>

This repository contains all the Gatsby themes by OpenArchitex community. Please feel free
to give them a try. If you have any suggestions for improvement do not hesitate to  open an [issue](https://github.com/OpenArchitex/gatsby-themes/issues/new/choose).

## Repo Details

This repository mimics the structure of [gatsby-starter-theme-workplace](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-theme-workspace) 
and use [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) for development. To
quickly start any theme in development mode you can use,

`yarn workspace @openarchitex/gatsby-theme-<theme-name> gatsby develop`

where `<theme-name>` should be replaced by the relevant theme. For example in the case of 
the Minimal Portfolio theme it will be,

`yarn workspace @openarchitex/gatsby-theme-minimal-portfolio develop`

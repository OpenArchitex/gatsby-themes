# Minimal Portfolio

This is an example portfolio created with [@openarchitex/gatsby-theme-minimal-portfolio](https://github.com/OpenArchitex/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-portfolio).

You can use [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to override the sections in the theme. 
All the files relevant to the theme should go under `@opanarchitex/gatsby-theme-minimal-portfolio`. 
For example the `banner.mdx` and `logo.svg` is overridden as an example. 

If you have any questions, issues or enhancements to this starter feel free to open an 
[issue at the gatsby-themes repo](https://github.com/OpenArchitex/gatsby-themes/issues).
